                We're waiting every night
                To finally roam and invite
                Newcomers to play with us
                For many years we've been all alone

                We're forced to be still and play
                The same songs we've known since that day
                An imposter took our life away
                Now we're stuck here to decay

                Don't lock us away!

                We're really quite surprised
                We get to see you another night
                You should have looked for another job
                You should have said to this place good-bye
                It's like there's so much more
                Maybe you've been in this place before
                We remember a face like yours
                You seem acquainted with those doors
